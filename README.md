# Tetris-My-Way
Tetris game developed in python (my way at least) using the pygame module

To run the game you need to download all the files on your local computer and run "Main.py".

How To Play
1. Enter your name on the console. your name will be used in storing your score in score.csv
2. Clear board lines using the dropping shapes as much as possible to increase your score
3. Controls:
  a. Arrows - UP key to rotate the shape
  b. Arrows - DOWN key to drop the shape fast
  c. Arrows - LEFT key to move the shape left
  d. Arrows - RIGHT key to move the shape right
  f. Space key to pause and unpause the game
  g. ESCAPE key, once a game is over use it to start a new game
4. Note that only the highest score is saved and displayed

Note: the game main purpose was to illustrate the integration of a class (Object Orineted), read and write files and importing a module. Please test it out and provide your comments and reviews.
